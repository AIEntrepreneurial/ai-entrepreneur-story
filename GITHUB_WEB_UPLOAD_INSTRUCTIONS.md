# GitHub Web Upload Instructions

## How to Upload Your Work to GitHub via Web Browser

Since Git operations are blocked from your location, you'll need to upload your work manually using GitHub's web interface.

## Step-by-Step Instructions:

### 1. Prepare Your Files
The following backup files have been created and are ready for upload:
- `ai-entrepreneur-story.bundle` - Complete Git repository with all history
- `ai-entrepreneur-story-backup.zip` - ZIP archive of all project files

### 2. Upload Process
1. Open your web browser and go to: https://github.com/AIEntrepreneurial/ai-entrepreneur-story
2. Log in to your GitHub account if prompted
3. On the repository page, click the "Add file" dropdown button (green button near top right)
4. Select "Upload files"
5. Drag and drop either or both of these files:
   - `ai-entrepreneur-story.bundle`
   - `ai-entrepreneur-story-backup.zip`
6. Add a commit message like "Upload project backup files"
7. Click "Commit changes"

### 3. Alternative: Upload Individual Files
If you prefer to work with individual files:
1. Extract `ai-entrepreneur-story-backup.zip`
2. Navigate to specific directories in the GitHub repository
3. Use the "Add file" -> "Upload files" option to upload specific folders/files
4. This allows you to recreate your project structure in GitHub

### 4. File Locations
Both backup files are located in your workspace directory:
`C:\Users\39653\.openclaw\workspace\`

## Important Notes:
- The `.bundle` file contains the complete Git history and can be cloned later to restore the full repository
- The `.zip` file contains all project files in a standard archive format
- Both files contain the same project content but in different formats
- After uploading, you can download these files from GitHub to any other machine and continue development

## Next Steps:
Once uploaded, you can:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub on other machines where Git operations work
2. Continue development normally
3. Use the web interface for future updates if Git operations remain blocked
